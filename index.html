            <h2> Our Story 📜</h2>
            <p class="hidden-content">Mangata & Gallo was born from a passion for timeless elegance and exquisite craftsmanship. Founded by Mariana, an expert in diamond cutting and metal smithing, our journey began in a small atelier in Austin, Texas. What started as a personal endeavor to create unique, handcrafted jewelry soon grew into an online boutique renowned for its classic yet modern designs.

                Mariana’s love for fine jewelry and commitment to quality have been the foundation of Mangata & Gallo’s success. With a small team of skilled artisans, each piece is designed with meticulous attention to detail, celebrating life’s most precious moments—engagements, weddings, anniversaries, and personal milestones.</p>
